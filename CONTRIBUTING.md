# Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution to Archivematica Issues Repository!

This repository is intended to be the main place to organizing issues in the Archivematica project, as of July 2018.
Prior to July 2018, issues have been filed across different repos in the https://github.com/artefactual and https://github.com/artefactual-labs/ organizations.

Complete details about how to contribute to the Archivematica project can be found here: https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/blob/stable/1.7.x/CONTRIBUTING.md

## Submitting bugs

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue.
Email info@artefactual.com instead.

Issues can be filed using GitHub Issues in the
[Archivematica Issues repo](https://github.com/archivematica/Issues). It is
recommended to file issues there rather than in any of the Archivematica-related
code repositories. Artefactual staff also use GitHub issues for any work they do
on the Archivematica project.

You can also post in our
[user](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/archivematica) mailing list.
A post to the mailing list is always welcome, especially if you're unsure if
it's a bug or a local problem!

Useful questions to answer if you're having problems include:

* What version of Archivematica and the Storage Service are you using?
* How was Archivematica installed? Package install, Ansible, etc?
* Was this a fresh install or an upgrade?
* What did you do to cause this bug to happen?
* What did you expect to happen?
* What did you see instead?
* Can you reproduce this reliably?
* If a specific Job is failing, what output did it produce? This is available by clicking on the gear icon.

## Submitting enhancement ideas

Similar to submitting bugs, you are welcome to submit ideas for enhancements or
new features in the
[Archivematica Issues repo](https://github.com/archivematica/Issues). This is
also where Artefactual staff record upcoming enhancements when they have been
sponsored for inclusion either by Artefactual Systems or by a client.

Please feel free also to use the
[Issues repo wiki](https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/wiki) as a space for
gathering and collaborating on ideas. If you are not already a member of the
Archivematica repo (required for editing the wiki), file an issue there with
the title "Request membership."
